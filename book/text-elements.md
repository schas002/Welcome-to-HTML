# Text elements

Instead of an introduction, try opening `simplest-web-page.html` in your browser. You'll see that the page is completely empty...

Now, let's see how to fill it with text.

## Headings

Headings are used to split up a page into sections similar to how a book is laid out. Let's try adding one.

Headings are displayed on the page, so they have to be put in the `<body>`.

```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```

Add this text to the `body` of the simplest web page, and save it somewhere *else*. Instead of the "Save" option in your text editor, use the "Save *as*" option.

Now open the new web page in a browser. You should see the text "Hello, World!"

**Congraubbulations**! You've just created your first web page!

Of course, I know it's very limited. But this page shows something, which is progress.

## Headings, again

A page usually uses more headings than just `h1` above.

Let's add a smaller heading.

```html
<h2>Hello, reader!</h2>
```

Put it in the body of the page you created earlier, and save it somewhere else.

Below the heading "Hello, World!" you should see the smaller heading "Hello, reader!" :-D

### A Note on Heading Types

There aren't just `h1` and `h2` headings. There are six levels of headings. `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5` and `h6`. `h1` defines the most important level of heading, where `h6` defines the least important one.
